## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
 ### Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

A p -value less than 0.05 (typically â‰¤ 0.05) is statistically significant. Intercept, vehicle_length and ground_clearance provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values as their pvalues are below 0.05.  the p-value of Intercept is 5.08e-08 which when expanded is a negative value. Likewise, both vehicle_length and ground_clearance have negative p-values. Vehicle_length has a p-value of 2.60e-12 and ground_clearance has one at 5.21e-08. The other variables all have p-values above 0.05 and are not significant. 

### Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
The p-value of this model can be seen on the last line in the image provided. The value is 5.35e-11 which is much smaller than 0.05. This indicates that the slope of the linear model is not zero. 

### Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
The r-squared value is 0.7149 which means that there is an approximately 71% chance at predicting the MPG for a vehicle. This is an effective model.
